# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
Steve's parents are interested in investing in green energy because they believe it is the technology of the future, so they invested all of their money into DAQO New Energy Corp without doing much research.
Steve recently earned a finance degree and promised to research the DAQO stock for his parents, but rather than investing all of the money, he wants to diversify the funds. Along with DAQO, he wants to look at a few more stocks with the help of Excel and VBA.

### Purpose
* The analysis' purpose is to assist Steve in analyzing the return on DAQO and other stocks in order to build a diversified portfolio for his parents.
* Considering researching each stock individually is time-consuming, we'll use a VBA script to automate the process and produce more reliable conclusions.


## Results
 * In **2017**, every stock returned a profit, with an average return of 67.3 percent.

      * DQ's Total Daily Volume had the _lowest_ volume of all the stocks, but the best return of _199.4 percent_.
      * Original Script took  0.73438 seconds
